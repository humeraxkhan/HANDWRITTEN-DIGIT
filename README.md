# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT
Handwritten Digit Classification

Handwritten digit classification is a machine learning task that involves identifying digits (0–9) from images, such as those in the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to train a model to recognize and classify these digits accurately based on pixel values.
Key Steps

    Dataset:
        Typically uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.
        The dataset is split into training and test sets.

    Preprocessing:
        Normalize pixel values to a range of 0–1.
        Reshape images for input compatibility with the model.

    Model Architecture:
        Neural networks, such as fully connected dense layers or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used.
        CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to detect spatial patterns.

    Training:
        Use a loss function like categorical cross-entropy.
        Optimize the model using techniques like gradient descent with optimizers such as Adam.

    Evaluation:
        Measure accuracy on the test set.
        Use confusion matrices and other metrics to assess performance.

    Applications:
        Automated form processing.
        Optical character recognition (OCR).
        Digit-based authentication system
